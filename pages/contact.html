                    A goal of her research is to understand the costs and

                    the Duke University School of Medicine. His research
                    interests focus on the psychological and neurobiological
                    processes of self-regulation, conceptualized in terms of a
                    cognitive/motivational perspective, as well as on the
                    relation between self-regulation and affect and how such
                    processes might contribute to psychopathology.

                  <p>
                    His lab's clinically focused research includes the
                    development and validation of a new self-regulation - based
                    therapy for depression, self-system therapy, and the use of
                    neuroimaging techniques to examine the mechanisms of action
                    of treatments for depression. He is a former president of
